#Facial Recognition using PCA and SVM:
## Problem Description:
Problem statement Facial recognition is an important and more preferred bio metric when compared to other bio metrics. One of the primary reason is that it requires no physical interaction on behalf of the user. For face recognition there are two types of comparisons:

- Verification: In this the system compares the given individual to that the individual says they are and responds with a yes or a no.

- Identification: This is where the system compares the given individual to all the other individuals in the database and recognizes that person.

**In this project we implement the Identification system using Machine Learning concepts such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).**

## Data Attribute Information
**Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: Since its a Continuous Variable therefore a Regression Problem.**
```
Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description Â¶

Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)

Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement

Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length

Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell

Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone

Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat

Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)

Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried

Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
```

##  Machine learning models:

```
    Linear Regressor
    SVR
    RandomForest Regressor
    ElasticNet Regression
    Lasso Regression
    Kernel Ridge Regression
    Gradient Boosting Regression
    XGBoost
    LightGBM
    can also try any other classifiers.
   
``` 
- use Gridsearch CV to tune algos
